      <h3>A software engineer and a full stack developer</h3>
      <span>
        During my two years as a Software Engineer at Visa Inc., India, I honed
        my software development skills by providing cryptographic solutions for
        data protection. This experience allowed me to collaborate
        cross-functionally, contributing significantly to onboarding clients to
        Visaâ€™s ecosystem and developing secure payment solutions. My proficiency
        extends to creating scalable and efficient systems, conducting code
        testing across agile cycles, and optimizing RESTful APIs. I optimized
        Splunk logs, and developed in-house tools s aving 100 man-hours,
        demonstrating efficiency and innovation. In my academic projects, I have
        created web and mobile applications using front-end and back-end
        languages and various frameworks, giving me in-depth knowledge of the
        subject.
        <br />
        <br />
        Having taken many leadership roles during my undergrads and working at
        Visa, I enhanced my leadership skills and became a better orator.
        Communicating with senior leaders in the company taught me how to be a
        better version of myself. Being a regular Toastmaster has helped me
        improve my speaking skills. Serving as an executive committee member of
        two clubs has further enhanced my ability to collaborate and lead
        effectively
